I have developed an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cube using this data warehouse, here I have used SSAS in SQL Data tool,This OLAP cube allows for efficient slicing and dicing of data across various dimensions, we can quickly analyze and gain insights into churn patterns and fault distribution across service regions, Location. 
we can perform a wide range of analyses to gain valuable insights into customer churn and service performance. Specifically, we can analyze:
